/**
 * Generated land for the Territories and Cities map styles (issues #3505,
 * #3506 and #3617): a land mask, a heightmap and a colour image, as plain
 * typed arrays. No canvas and no DOM, so it runs in vitest and in the webview
 * alike.
 *
 * The land comes first and the map is cut from it afterwards. Fractal noise is
 * laid over a broad mask that gives the shape (one continent, two, an
 * archipelago or land around an inland sea), and both are read through a
 * second noise that bends the coordinates, so a coast wanders instead of
 * tracing a circle. The sea level is set so a fixed share of the map is land.
 * Specks of land are sunk and small lakes are filled.
 *
 * The same seed has to give the same pixels on Windows, macOS and Linux, since
 * a saved map keeps its seed and not its pixels (issue #2167 is the galaxy
 * generator failing at this). So everything here is integer arithmetic or one
 * of the operations IEEE 754 defines exactly: add, subtract, multiply, divide
 * and `Math.sqrt`. There is no `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, `Math.pow`, `Math.exp`,
 * `Math.log`, `Math.atan2` or `Math.hypot`. A direction is a unit vector found
 * by rejection sampling. `terrainGolden.test.ts` pins a hash of every array.
